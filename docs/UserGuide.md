--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/releases). Optionally, also download the images.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your DraftDeck.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Important:**
Ensure the folder is **not write-protected**. DraftDeck will not work properly if placed in a write-protected directory, as it needs to create data files and configuration files.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If you wish to use images, place the downloaded images folder here as well!
</div>

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar draftdeck.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Note for Windows users:**
Double-clicking the jar file might not work on some systems. If this happens, use the command line method: open Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the jar file, and type `java -jar draftdeck.jar`.
</div>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all players.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com i/JohnD88 r/MID rank/GOLD I` : Adds a player named `John Doe` to the player list.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd indexed player.

   * `clear` : Deletes all players.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
First time using this app? Consider going through the [walkthrough](#walkthrough-setting-up-the-national-esports-team) first to get a feel for things!
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items in round brackets are required, but are in an either|or format.<br>
  e.g `(INDEX | i/IGN)` can be `1` or `i/Player1`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

### Sports and Analytics

#### Comparing players : `compare`

Compares two players identified by their index numbers.

Format: `compare (INDEX1 | i/IGN1) (INDEX2 | i/IGN2)`

* Displays details of both players side by side.
* The indices refer to the index numbers shown in the displayed person list.
* Indices **must be positive integers** 1, 2, 3, …​
* The two players must be different.

Example:
* `compare 1 2` Compares the 1st and 2nd indexed players in the current list.
* `compare i/AlexY42 2` Compares the player with the IGN AlexY42 and the 2nd indexed player in the current list.

#### Drafting a team : `draft`

Validates and analyzes a team composition.

Format: `draft (INDEX | i/IGN) (INDEX | i/IGN) (INDEX | i/IGN) (INDEX | i/IGN) (INDEX | i/IGN)​`

* Selects exactly 5 unique players by their index numbers or in-game names (IGN).
* Analyzes the team composition and reports findings, including:
  * Composition breakdown (count of players by role)
  * Validation status (✓ Valid if exactly one player per role, ✗ Invalid otherwise)
  * Average team rank
  * Any composition issues (e.g., missing roles, duplicate roles)
* You can mix indices and IGNs in the same command.
* The `i/` prefix can optionally be omitted for non-numeric IGNs (e.g., `PlayerA` instead of `i/PlayerA`).
* **Note**: Invalid compositions are not rejected; instead, the command shows diagnostic information about the issues.

Examples:
* `draft 1 2 3 4 5` Drafts players at indices 1-5.
* `draft i/PlayerA i/PlayerB i/PlayerC i/PlayerD i/PlayerE` Drafts players by their IGNs.
* `draft 1 2 i/CarlK77 4 i/ElleM55` Mixes indices and IGNs.

#### Updating player statistics : `stats`

Updates the statistics of a player for a specific entity.

Format: `stats (INDEX | i/IGN) ent/ENTITY [k/KILLS] [d/DEATHS] [a/ASSISTS]`

* Updates the person at the specified `INDEX`, or with the specified IGN. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* `ent/ENTITY` is required and specifies which champion the statistics are for.
* At least one of the statistics fields (kills, deaths, assists) must be provided.
* Existing statistics for the entity will be added to the new values.
* Statistics for entities are added to the player's total statistics.

Examples:
* `stats 1 ent/Ahri k/50 d/10 a/20` Adds 50 kills, 10 deaths, and 20 assists to player 1's Ahri statistics.
* `stats 2 ent/Leona k/0 d/5 a/15` Adds 0 kills, 5 deaths, and 15 assists to player 2's Leona statistics.

#### Adding match results : `result`

Adds a match result to the match record.

Format: `result w/RESULT [date/yyyy-MM-dd] i/IGN ent/ENTITY s/KILLS-DEATHS-ASSISTS`

* All players and entities must exist in DraftDeck.
* Also updates the statistics of all players involved in the match.
* `w/RESULT` must be one of: `WIN`, `LOSE`, `DRAW`. Not case-sensitive.
* `date/yyyy-MM-dd` is optional. If not provided, uses the current date.

### Saving the data

DraftDeck data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

DraftDeck data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, DraftDeck will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the DraftDeck to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous DraftDeck home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Walkthrough: Setting Up the National Esports Team

Welcome to DraftDeck! This walkthrough will guide you through a realistic scenario where you're a team manager setting up a new esports team for an upcoming tournament. You'll learn how to use DraftDeck's key features to manage players, analyze data, and prepare your team for competition.

## Scenario Overview
{:.no_toc}

You've just been hired as the team manager for the Singapore National Esports team, ahead of the upcoming Asian Games. Your first task is to:

1. Build a roster of 6 players (5 starters + 1 substitute)
2. Analyze player statistics and compare recruits
3. Draft a valid team composition
4. Record match data from practice games

Let's get started!

---

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If you ever get stuck on a command, you can use the `help` command!
</div>

## Step 1: Launch DraftDeck and import the old roster.
{:.no_toc}

First, download the tutorial data file, found here.
Download and unzip it. It should contain a `data` folder. Use it to overwrite the existing the data folder.
Next, launch the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If there is no data folder that exists, that's fine! It just means you haven't launched the app before. You can just paste the folder in and it will still work correctly.
</div>

## Step 1.5: Install images (Optional)
{:.no_toc}

This step is optional, but recommended.
If you downloaded the release with the image pack, simply drop the `image` folder the same way you dropped the `data` folder, then restart the app. The final directory containing the app should look like this.


The rest of the screenshots in this tutorial will assume you have installed the `image` folder.

## Step 2: View Your Complete Roster
{:.no_toc}

Now let's see all your players at once.

### Command:
{:.no_toc}

```
list
```

**Expected Output:**
All 11 players are displayed in a numbered list, showing their name, phone, email, IGN, role, rank, and tags. You should see:

![List](images/WalkthroughList.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If the list is empty, or contains fewer than 11 players, you probably imported the tutorial data incorrectly. In such a scenario, simply delete the data folder and restart from Step 1.
</div>

---

## Step 3: Add new Players
{:.no_toc}

Between the last Asian Games and the current one, some new talent has emerged.
Specifically, a certain 'Koh Kai Jie' from team 'FaerieCharm'. His IGN is 'Dust', his rank is Challenger, and he plays the top lane.
Suppose his phone number is 93032101, and his email is kkj@gmail.com. Then, the command to add him will like as follows:

```
add n/Koh Kai Jie p/93032101 e/kkj@gmail.com i/Dust r/TOP rank/Challenger t/FaerieCharm
```

**Expected Output:**
Scrolling to the bottom of the list, we see that he has been added to the list.

However, he has no champions played yet. This is expected - we have not added any stats for him!

![Add](images/WalkthroughAdd.png)

## Step 4: Adding past matches
{:.no_toc}

There are two ways we can go about adding past matches. We can either use the `result` command, which keeps track of dates, or the `stats` command.

For this case, we shall use the `stats` command. There are three games that we want to include:

| Champion | Kills | Deaths | Assists |
| - | - | - | - |
| Gwen | 2 | 9 | 4 |
| Rumble | 16 | 20 | 18 |
| Yorick | 3 | 6 | 5 |

The commands are thus as follows:

```
stats 12 ent/Gwen k/2 d/9 a/4
stats 12 ent/Rumble k/16 d/20 a/18
stats 12 ent/Yorick k/3 d/6 a/5
```

**Expected Output:**
Scrolling to the bottom of the list, we see that he now has three champions in his pool. Clicking on any one of them reveals the stats we have inputted.

![Stats](images/WalkthroughStats.png)



## Step 5: Find Specific Players
{:.no_toc}

Let's say you need to quickly find players with specific criteria.

### Find by Name
{:.no_toc}

Search for players named "Chen."

**Command:**
```
find Chen
```

**Expected Output:**
Lee Chen Ming and Chen Yi Hui are displayed.

![Find](images/WalkthroughFind.png)

### Filter by Role
{:.no_toc}

View all players tagged as "TOP."

**Command:**
```
filter r/top
```

**Expected Output:**
4 players are listed.

### Filter by Multiple Criteria
{:.no_toc}

Find all top players from team Impunity.

**Command:**
```
filter r/top t/Impunity
```

**Expected Output:**
Only 1 player is listed, CYH.

---

## Step 6: Compare Two Players
{:.no_toc}

You're considering whether to start Dust or Revive for an upcoming match. Let's compare them.

### Command:
{:.no_toc}

```
compare i/Dust i/Revive
```

**Expected Output:**
A side-by-side comparison showing:
- **Dust (Koh Kai Jie):** TOP, CHALLENGER
- **Revive (Daniel Tan):** TOP, CHALLENGER

This helps you make an informed decision on their different champion pools. What they have in common, and what champions they each uniquely play compared to each other.

In this case, the only common champion they play is Rumble.

![Compare](images/WalkthroughCompare.png)

---

## Step 7: Draft a Valid Team Composition
{:.no_toc}

Now let's practice drafting a valid 5-player team. A valid team needs exactly one player for each role.

### Command:
{:.no_toc}

```
draft 12 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Valid team composition!
TOP: Dust
JUNGLE: CraliX
MID: Raven
BOT: Ciela
SUPPORT: Kra
```

### Try an Invalid Composition
{:.no_toc}

Let's see what happens if we try to draft an invalid team (missing a role).

**Command:**
```
draft 12 2 3 4 6
```

**Expected Output:**
A message indicating the team composition is invalid, because you're missing a SUPPORT player (index 6 is Blaire, a TOP laner).

---

## Step 8: Record Match Result
{:.no_toc}

Your team just won their first practice match! Let's record the result. This is the statline for each player.

| Player | Champion | Kills | Deaths | Assists |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Dust | Gwen | 3 | 0 | 4 |
| CraliX | Zed | 5 | 1 | 2 |
| Raven | Anivia | 1 | 6 | 5 |
| Ciela | Zeri | 2 | 4 | 0 |
| Kra | Ashe | 1 | 3 | 9 |

We could use the `stats` command again, but since we are tracking multiple players, combined with the fact that this is a match our team played together, we can use the `result` command to add them all at once, as well as storing the date and match result for future reference.

### Command:
{:.no_toc}

```
result w/WIN date/2026-09-01 i/Dust ent/Gwen k/3 d/0 a/4 i/CraliX ent/Zed k/5 d/1 a/2 i/Raven ent/Anivia k/1 d/6 a/5 i/Ciela ent/Zeri k/2 d/4 a/0 i/Kra ent/Ashe k/1 d/3 a/9
```

**Expected Output:**
A confirmation message indicating that the match has been saved.

```
Players: [Dust{statistics=Kills: 3, Deaths: 0, Assists: 4}, CraliX{statistics=Kills: 5, Deaths: 1, Assists: 2}, Raven{statistics=Kills: 1, Deaths: 6, Assists: 5}, Ciela{statistics=Kills: 2, Deaths: 4, Assists: 0}, Kra{statistics=Kills: 1, Deaths: 3, Assists: 9}]
```

## Step 9: Player Management
{:.no_toc}

### Editing Player Information
{:.no_toc}

Dust has a new phone number.

**Command:**
```
edit 12 p/98765432
```

**Expected Output:**
Confirmation that Dust's phone number has been updated.

### Removing a Player
{:.no_toc}

If you need to remove a player from your the list:

**Command:**
```
delete 1
```

**Expected Output:**
Revive is removed from the list. The remaining players are renumbered accordingly.
